# üç∞ Bakery Management System

A modern solution for bakery inventory management with a microservices architecture.

## üîç System Overview

The Bakery Management System helps bakery owners track and manage their inventory with ease. Admins can add, update, delete, and monitor stock levels of bakery items through a clean React interface backed by a powerful Node.js API.

- **Frontend**: React.js for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for business logic and API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for service communication
- **Logging**: Morgan for comprehensive request logging
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose for microservices

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Getting started is simple with our Docker setup:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Adityasahni04/Bakery-App.git
   cd Bakery-App
   ```

2. **Launch everything with a single command**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   ```
   http://localhost:80
